<h3>Examples: Frances Haugen: Facebook whistleblower</h3>
<p>Frances Haugen (Facebook) she worked as product manager she leaked infomation about Facebook which was about growth and safety. She talked about how Facebook was selling personal infomation and Facebook claimed the leaks were misleading and not accurate. Facebook also then fired her and this was a whole big case that went on. Because of this her reputation is ruined although she did what is right other businesses dont see it as a positive. This means it may be harder go get a job for her.</p>

<h3>Examples: Tyler Shultz</h3>
<p>George Shultz was on the Theranos Board of Directors and had asked Holmes to offer Tyler Shultz a job opportunity. Shortly afterward, Tyler Shultz joined Theranos as an intern as a research engineer. During 8 months Theranos worked closely with Erika Cheungthey and they found out  removing outliers from its data, and not producing accurate results and running blood samples in a secret lab, using commercially available machines. Theranos Edison Machine it had told investors and people it was using. He then contacted John Carreyrou of the Wall Street Journal and he helped expose them.</p>

<h3>Examples: Cher Scarlett</h3>
<p>She worked in Apple as a software engineer. group created a website, on which they posted anonymous reports of mistreatment, including verbal and sexual abuse, discrimination, retaliation, poor working conditions, and unequal pay experienced by Apple workers. Later taht next year Scarlet filed a charge with the NLRB, alleging that Apple voilated the law by making employees stop talking about there salaries. At the end of the day she recvived 1 years pay and so did her colleges. This also means that it shows a negeitive example on Scarlet due to no one going to hire them and to this day us as people dont even know much about this case and have not heard about it except reading it now. It impacted her more than the company. </p>
